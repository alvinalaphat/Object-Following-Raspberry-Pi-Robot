The application we decided to use is an algorithm called
Circular Hough transform which detects and outlines a circular object in a frame. We supplement this by applying a yellow HSV mask 
similar to what we did in practical 1 to identify the yellow tennis ball. The approach will be to use the 
similar circular hough transform algorithm to identify the shape of the ball, a yellow mask to 
identify the object,consistent lighting conditions, a contrasting background, motors to move towards the ball,
and wheels to make turns and keep the ball in the center of the camera frame attached to the raspberry Pi. 

We manually collected 30 images of a tennis ball for our training/test set. We will use 20 for training and 10 for test.
By tweaking the hyperparameters of our hough transform model through trial and error of our training data, we can learn which accumulator resolution and
threshold to use as well as the min and max radius of the ball we are detecting. Our training data of different ball angles and lighting will
make the edge detection more robust and accurate by giving us a broad range of HSV values as well. 

We also have a dataset of tennis balls obtained from kaggle.com at this link:
