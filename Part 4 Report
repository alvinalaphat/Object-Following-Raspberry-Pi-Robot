We chose to use Hough transform to identify the shape of the tennis ball in the video because it’s commonly
used for circular objects and it excels in detecting them when there is a sharp contrast between the pixel colors 
along the detected edges. We can use a modified version of this method called HoughCircles which takes a grayscale image and
multiple other parameters that we were able to set based on trial and error with our training data
of tennis ball pictures and live video capture. The parameters we set for the function are Hough
Gradient (detection method), inverse ratio of the accumulator resolution, the minimum distance
between the centers of the detected circles (to avoid overlap but this doesn’t apply here),
accumulator threshold, minimum circle radius, and maximum circle radius. Also, while Hough
Transform can have its limitations such as not performing well under noisy images, we don’t
expect there to be excess noise in our testing environment. Canny edge detection is already
used implicitly by Hough Transform and Hough transform uses only 3 simple hyper parameters
in its voting algorithm to detect circles that are in contrast with the surrounding pixels.
