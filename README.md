# Object-Following-Raspberry-Pi-Robot

Project by Alvin Alaphat and Luke Marushack


## Instructions for running
After installing dependencies, just run the ball_detection.py program and try holding a tennis ball in front of the camera on the raspberry pi. 
The terminal will print the directions the car is following the ball in so you can see the object tracking methods.
