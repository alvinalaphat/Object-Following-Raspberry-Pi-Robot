For our project, we don't need a repeated database as it turns out the application demonstrated in the project selection demo used an algorithm called
Circular Hough transform to mainly detect a circular object in a frame and applied a yellow mask similar to what we did in practical 1 to identify
the yellow tennis ball. Since our project relies less on classification and more on identification/recognition, there is no training or test set needed.
