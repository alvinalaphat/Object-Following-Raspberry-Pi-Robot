The application demonstrated in the project selection demo used an algorithm called
Circular Hough transform to detect a circular object in a frame and it then applied a yellow mask 
similar to what we did in practical 1 to identify the yellow tennis ball. The approach will be to use the 
similar circular hough transform algorithm to identify the shape of the ball, a yellow mask to 
identify the object,consistent lighting conditions, a contrasting background, motors to move towards the ball,
and wheels to make turns and keep the ball in the center of the camera frame attached to the raspberry Pi. 

We collected 30 images of a tennis ball for our training/test set. We will likely use 20 for training and 10 for test.
We can collect parameters for our hough transform model from this training data to make the edge detection more robust and accurate. 

We also have a dataset of tennis balls obtained from kaggle.com at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/cuauhtemoccontreras/tennis-ball-detection/data
